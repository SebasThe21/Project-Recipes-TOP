    <p>These are fried plantains that have been smashed and fried a second time. It is essential you use very ripe plantains. This recipe is straight from my Colombian mother-in-law. Enjoy!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Â½ cup oil for frying</li>
        
        <li>1 ripe plantain, peeled and cut into 1-inch rounds</li>

        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a plate, upside-down, onto a work surface.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry plantain slices in the hot oil until slightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer plantain slices using a slotted spoon onto the upside-down plate, reserving oil in the skillet. Place a second plate, right-side up, onto the plantains. Smash the plantain slices by gently pressing the top plate into the bottom plate.</li>
        <li>Place the smashed plantains in the hot oil and fry until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer fried plantains to a paper towel-lined plate and sprinkle salt over plantains.</li>
    </ol>
