    <h1>Aji for the machos</h1>

    <img src="../images/aji.webp" alt="aji pa hombres">
    <p>This fresh, tangy Colombian-style salsa pairs well with all grilled meats, empanadas, tostones, tacos, or eggs. Make it mild or extra-spicy, if you dare!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large plum tomato, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>1 bunch fresh cilantro, stems removed</li>
        <li>½ small onion, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>1 jalapeño pepper, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>½ lime, juiced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 bunch green onions, finely chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        Combine tomato, cilantro, onion, jalapeño, and garlic in a food processor. Add oil, lime juice, sugar, vinegar, and salt. Pulse until a coarse paste forms. Fold in green onions.
    </ol>

    <h3>Cook notes</h3>
    <p>Substitute 1 teaspoon garlic paste for the garlic cloves if preferred.

        Please note that the heat level in this salsa can be adjusted with more or less jalapeño to suit your taste. If you're uncertain of your heat tolerance, I highly recommend leaving the jalapeños out, transferring the salsa to a bowl, and adding them gradually while tasting frequently. I sometimes put the jalapeño and a bit of olive oil into a small Magic Bullet® blender and turn it into a paste, then add it to the salsa very slowly. This also allows you to separate the salsa into mild and spicy batches.</p>
